# UniversityCampusMaps
A Campus Map of the University of Washington that determines the shortest path between locations. Path distances are calculated using Dijkstra's algorithm 

Key Focuses of this Project:
* Determining abstract data type for graph implementation
* Implementing test suits
* Full-stack development with React.js
* Front end
